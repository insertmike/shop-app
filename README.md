# weShop app :iphone:
Project overview,functuonalities and dependencies from my August built *weShop* app, with main focus on State Management.

Designed by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, implemented by me.
 ## Project Overview
*weShop* is online mobile cross-platform application, which allows users to shop variety of items on the market, as well as to add their own items and sell them to the public.

- ### Overall Approach
  - Used the [Provider Package & Pattern](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to distribute the data upon the entire app. 
  - Used the [Google's Firabase Web Server](https://firebase.google.com), which is internally communicating with the users db.
  - Used Token Authentication - Stateless *RESTful API* to provide endpoints, to which the users are sending requests to get authenticated.
